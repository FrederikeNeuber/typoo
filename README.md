# typoo: an ontology to describe microtypography 

## Description

typoo is short for "TYPOgraphy as Ontology". It is a model for the description of material-visual aspects of typefaces from Western Europe from around 1900. It is a RDF/OWL-based ontology to describe microtypography (in digital scholarly editions), i.e. the design and usage of fonts. The ontology was first developed within the context of a digital edition and is therefore primarily tailored to their needs. In this repository, however, the ontology is to be further generalized in order to make it more widely applicable.

At the moment (April 2020) typoo consists of 52 classes and 17 object properties whose conceptions and definitions are a constant "work-in-progress" (please share your own ideas!).
