# typoo

## Description

typoo is short for "TYPOgraphy as Ontology". It is a RDF/OWL-based ontology to describe microtypography (in digital scholarly editions), i.e. the design and usage of fonts. 

typoo consists of 52 classes and 17 object properties whose conceptions and definitions are a constant "work-in-progress" (please share your own ideas!).
