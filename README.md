# typoo: an ontology to describe microtypography 

## Description

typoo is short for "TYPOgraphy as Ontology" and a model to describe microtypography, i.e. the design and usage of fonts in printed matter. typoo is formalized in the "Web Ontology Language" OWL and available in its serializations RDF/XML and Turtle. At the moment (April 2020), typoo consists of 52 classes, 18 object properties and one data property. The conceptions and definitions are a constant "work-in-progress" (please share your own ideas!). 

The focus of the typoo lies on material-visual aspects of typefaces from Western Europe from around 1900. The ontology was first developed and successfully implemented within the context of a digital scholarly edition (to be published, [more info](https://github.com/FrederikeNeuber/stgd-prototype-edition)) and is therefore primarily tailored to its needs. In this repository, however, the ontology is to be further generalized in order to make it more widely applicable and/or to allow a mapping to similar resources.
